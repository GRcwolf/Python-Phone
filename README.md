This is a useless application i wrote for TBZ module m120.

The module is written in python3. You may need to install `tkinker` for python before you are able to run the application.

You can install this python module under Ubuntu by typing the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

This module should also be compatible with python 2. To install tkinker in python 2 under Ubuntu, type the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-tk
```
